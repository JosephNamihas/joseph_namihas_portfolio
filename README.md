# Joseph Namihas - Web Portfolio

## My Web Portfolio

This portfolio is a collection of projects to showcase to future employers. I will slowly be building this up to reflect the new skills I learn and to add projects I complete.

Currently, I only have two projects to showcase. I have left a project window blank to highlight my intention to fill them in the coming weeks and months.

My motivation for this project was to provide me with a piece of work which I can update throughout my learning. Anything new I learn that I deem valuable to showcase, I will add in some capacity to this portfolio.

In the coming year, I will no doubt be relying on this page to showcase my talents and what I can offer a potential employer.

As a note, I would like to say that I am not entirely happy with the current design of the page. There's still some functionality I need to add, which I simply didn't have time to get right without sweeping changes (media queries). The general look of it is not appealing right now and I will go back and make it more visual in the coming weeks. 

## Challenges Faced

### Getting hands on with CSS Grid

Slowly getting more comfortable with CSS Grid, but had to do quite a bit of research on wrapping images within the grid cells. I'm still not entirely happy with the current look, but this will be rectified in due course.

### Design

Colour schemes, borders, images...I found this more troublesome than I would have originally thought. Sometimes, things you think of, don't translate well to page.

## Useage

For some reason I couldn't upload a web screenshot like last time. I have broken it down into the three main sections
