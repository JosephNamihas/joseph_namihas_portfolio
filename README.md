# Unit 2 Challenge: Portfolio

## My Web Portfolio

This portfolio is a collection of projects to showcase to future employers. I will slowly be building this up to reflect the new skills I learn and to add projects I complete.

Currently, I only have two projects to showcase. I have left two project windows blank to highlight my intention to fill them in the coming weeks and months.

## Challenges Faced

### Getting hands on with CSS Grid

Slowly getting more comfortable with CSS Grid. 

### Design

Colour schemes, borders, images...I found this more troublesome than I would have originally thought. Sometimes, things you think of, don't translate well to page. 

### Applying Images

Getting certain images to fit into CSS Grid Cells, making sure they're the right measurements. 

## Installation
